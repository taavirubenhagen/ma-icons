# Design guidelines for Ma Icons (not complete)

## General

### Setup

Icons are designed on a `64x64` grid in Figma with an `8x8` layout grid.

### Default values for variable properties

- `stroke` (stroke width): `5`
- `color` (fill color): `hsla(0, 0, 0, 1)`

## Details

### Spacing

- The strokes of `rectangles` and `polygons` in Figma are aligned on their inside, `lines` are centered.
- A 90 degree corner has a default corner radius of `12`; for stylized app icons, the default is `16`.
- Lines have round ends.
- The default gap between two strokes is `16`.
- The default side padding is `2`.
